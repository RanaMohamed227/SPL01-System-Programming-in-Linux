### CREATE NEW PROCCESS
exec system call -exce family --> wide options 

Fork system call --> create a child process
void function 
return pid --> number 

dplicate current process that called fork system call

- at the time of calling the fork it will duplicate as its all memory segments are copied 
- after fork line we jumped to kerenl mode we exceuting frk handler
- - now we want to return to user mode
- now we have two process running the same program but two differentprocess have different schdeling time --> different IDs 
- proccess clled fork the parent has no problems
- the problem is in the child
- from where it starts exceution ?? cant not start from the begining as we will enter recurssive function of fork --> the fork will keep called by the child
- - so the child starts exceution after the line of fork
  




    #### errors on why fork would not work and how to know that

* **Resource Limits Exceeded:** System lacks sufficient memory to allocate for the new process.
* **Process Limit Reached:** User has reached the maximum number of processes allowed.
* **Kernel Parameter Limits:** Kernel parameter `pid_max` is too low to allow additional processes.
* **Memory Allocation Issues:** Insufficient memory or swap space to accommodate the new process.
* **Permission Issues:** User does not have the necessary permissions to create new processes.
* **Code Errors:** Incorrect implementation or improper error handling in the `fork()` call.
* **Resource Starvation:** Excessive process creation (`fork bomb`) preventing further forks.
* **System Out of PIDs:** All available process IDs have been exhausted.
* **File Descriptor Limits:** System cannot allocate more file descriptors for the new process.
* **Security Restrictions:** Security policies or sandboxing prevent process creation.

### âœ… **What is a System Daemon?**

* **Definition:** A daemon is a background process that runs continuously in a Unix/Linux system to perform specific tasks or provide services without direct user interaction.

* **Characteristics:**

  * Runs in the background without a terminal or user interface.
  * Typically starts during system boot and stops during shutdown.
  * Usually ends with a `d` suffix (e.g., `httpd`, `sshd`, `crond`).

* **Examples of System Daemons:**

  * `sshd`: Handles secure shell (SSH) connections.
  * `crond`: Executes scheduled tasks using cron jobs.
  * `httpd`: Manages HTTP web server processes.
  * `systemd`: Manages system initialization and service control.
  * `syslogd`: Handles logging system messages.

* **Purpose and Usage:**

  * Provides essential services like networking, printing, and logging.
  * Performs scheduled tasks, monitoring, and server maintenance.
  * Listens for specific requests or triggers and responds accordingly.

* **Managing Daemons:**

  * Start, stop, and manage daemons using commands like `systemctl`, `service`, or `init.d`.
