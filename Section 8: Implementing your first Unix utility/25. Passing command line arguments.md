instead of writing the path ofthe fle in the code we want to pass the name of the file to the cat utility to be able to write any file in the command terminal


tokinization and pasiing multiple argumrnts called argument array then sending it to the kernel 



the upper part called arg v the memory segment where we store the argument and the arg c is the number of the count

arg v is a pointer to a string

after the kerenl manage the virtual memory for the process the kerenl copies the arg to the stack

so how the proccess can get the variable/arguments

### the main function takes arguments 


From the kernel's perspective, passing argc and argv to the main() function is a mechanism to provide a controlled and structured way to deliver command-line arguments to a process. Here’s how it works in detail:

1. Process Creation and Memory Layout:
When a program is executed, the kernel performs several steps:

Loading the Executable:

The kernel loads the executable file (e.g., myargs.c) into memory.

It sets up the process address space, including the stack, heap, and code segments.

Setting Up the Stack:

The kernel populates the stack with the command-line arguments (argv) and the argument count (argc).

+----------------------+
|        NULL          | <-- argv[argc]
+----------------------+
|     argv[argc-1]     |
+----------------------+
|        ...           |
+----------------------+
|     argv[1]          |
+----------------------+
|     argv[0]          |  <-- Pointer to program name
+----------------------+
|         argc         |  <-- Integer representing argument count
+----------------------+






The kernel provides the argument count (argc) to the program to prevent buffer overflow and to allow iteration through the argv array.

This allows the program to know how many arguments have been passed.

argv:

The kernel provides an array of pointers to strings (argv), each pointing to a command-line argument.

argv[0] is always the name of the executable (or the path used to invoke it).

argv[1] to argv[argc-1] are the actual arguments passed to the program.




3. Kernel System Call:
The kernel uses the execve() system call to start a new program. The prototype of execve() is:

           int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);


argv is passed as a null-terminated array of strings.

argc is implicitly determined by the length of argv.


When the kernel calls the execve() system call, it sets up the stack with the argc and argv parameters in a structured way before transferring control to the program’s entry point (_start).

### Run the file

The program is executed without any command-line arguments other than the program name itself.


argc = 1:

argc represents the number of command-line arguments.

Since only the program name (./myargs) is provided, argc is 1.

argv[0]:

argv[0] is always the name of the program or the command used to invoke the program.

In this case, it is ./myargs

shell parse command line and then send the info to the kernel 

the kernel constructs the array but the cmd only collect the info to the kernel 




### some playing with the cmd

1- 2 args
2- 1 args
