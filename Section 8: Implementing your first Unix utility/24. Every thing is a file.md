## In UNIX everything is a file

hence we will use limited number of calls to manage the wole system 

then the terminal is afile and the hard disk is a file the keyboard is a file every every thing is a file 

so how using a limited n8mber of calls we managed everything and complex task 

## univeral io model

everything is a file 
1- open file
2- read file 
3- write file 
4- close file 
main 4 system calls 


1- open file 
using command man 2 open 

 The  return value of open() is a file descriptor, a
       small, nonnegative integer that is an index  to  an
       entry  in the process's table of open file descrip‐
       tors.  The file descriptor is  used  in  subsequent
       system  calls  (read(2),  write(2),  lseek(2),  fc‐
       ntl(2), etc.)  to refer to the open file.  The file
       descriptor returned by a successful  call  will  be
       the  lowest-numbered  file descriptor not currently
       open for the process.


  The  argument flags must include one of the follow‐
       ing access modes: O_RDONLY,  O_WRONLY,  or  O_RDWR.
       These  request  opening  the file read-only, write-
       only, or read/write, respectively.

       In addition, zero or more file creation  flags  and
       file  status  flags  can  be bitwise ORed in flags.
       The file creation  flags  are  O_CLOEXEC,  O_CREAT,
       O_DIRECTORY,  O_EXCL,  O_NOCTTY, O_NOFOLLOW, O_TMP‐
       FILE, and O_TRUNC.  The file status flags  are  all
       of  the remaining flags listed below.  The distinc‐
       tion between these two groups of flags is that  the
       file  creation  flags  affect  the semantics of the
       open operation itself, while the file status  flags
       affect  the semantics of subsequent I/O operations.

2- read file 
man 2 read 


RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the  number of bytes read is returned
       (zero indicates end of file), and the file position
       is advanced by this number.  It is not an error  if
       this number is smaller than the number of bytes re‐
       quested;  this may happen for example because fewer
       bytes are actually available right now  (maybe  be‐
       cause  we  were close to end-of-file, or because we
       are reading from a pipe, or from  a  terminal),  or
       because  read()  was  interrupted by a signal.  See
       also NOTES.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indi‐
       cate the error.  In this case, it is left  unspeci‐
       fied whether the file position (if any) changes.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The  file  descriptor  fd  refers  to a file
              other than a socket and has been marked non‐
              blocking (O_NONBLOCK), and  the  read  would
              block.   See  open(2) for further details on
              the O_NONBLOCK flag.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The file descriptor fd refers  to  a  socket
              and  has  been  marked  nonblocking  (O_NON‐
              BLOCK),   and   the   read   would    block.
              POSIX.1-2001  allows  either error to be re‐
              turned for this case, and does  not  require
              these constants to have the same value, so a
              portable  application  should check for both
              possibilities.

3- write

4- close file

## for example cat utility 
1- open file   2- read 3- wrote it in terminal



## Implement this utility 

1- get required includes

2- write the open part in the code

3- Add the open part in the code

4- run the file

5- OHHH NOOOO

note: we read vut did not write

6- add the writing part

7- run again 
wowwwww it worked ^0^

8- but it read part of it , now we want to read the whole file
