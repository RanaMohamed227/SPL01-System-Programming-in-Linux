\\ a system call is just the agreed-upon “doorway” that user‐mode programs use to ask the kernel—Linux’s privileged core—to do things they can’t do themselves (like talk to disks, manage memory, or send data over the network).

---

## Why do we need a system call?

* **Protection and isolation.** User programs run in “ring 3” (unprivileged). The kernel runs in “ring 0” (privileged). If every program could directly poke hardware or tweak memory arbitrarily, the system would quickly become unstable or insecure.
* **Controlled services.** By funneling all requests through a small, well-defined interface, the kernel can enforce permissions, track resources, and prevent one program from crashing or snooping on another.

---

## What happens, conceptually?

1. **Prepare your request.**
   You decide which service you need (open a file, write to the console, allocate memory, etc.). Each service is assigned a unique number.

2. **Package arguments.**
   You put the service number and up to six parameters into registers (on x86-64 Linux).

   * Service ID → RAX
   * args 1–3 → RDI, RSI, RDX
   * args 4–6 → R10, R8, R9

3. **Trap into the kernel.**
   Executing the `syscall` instruction causes a **mode switch**:

   * The CPU flips into ring 0 (kernel mode).
   * It jumps to a fixed entry point in the kernel, saving your user‐mode context.

4. **Kernel handles the request.**
   Inside the kernel, a dispatcher looks at RAX to see which service you asked for, fetches your arguments from the other registers, and runs the appropriate internal routine (e.g., “write these bytes to this file descriptor”).

5. **Return to user space.**
   When that routine finishes, the kernel places its result (or an error code) back into RAX, then performs `sysret` (or the inverse to `syscall`), switching back to ring 3 and resuming your program right after the `syscall` instruction.

---

## Analogy

Think of a system call like placing an order in a restaurant:

1. You (the customer/program) decide what you want.
2. You fill out a form (registers) with your order number (service ID) and details (arguments).
3. You hand it over through a slot in the wall (the `syscall` trap).
4. The kitchen (kernel) prepares your meal.
5. The waiter (the return path) brings it back to your table (your registers).

You never wander back into the kitchen yourself—this keeps you safe and prevents chaos in the restaurant.

---

## Why “syscall” vs. a normal function call?

* **Privilege switch.** A normal call (`call`/`ret`) stays entirely in user mode. It can’t cross into the kernel.
* **Security boundary.** `syscall` invokes the CPU’s hardware mechanism to change privilege level and jump to a protected handler.
* **Stable API.** User programs link against libc wrappers (e.g. `write()`, `exit()`) which in turn emit the right `syscall` sequence. If Linux’s internals evolve, libc can adapt without your code changing.

---

In your example, you see two system calls back-to-back:

1. **`write(1, msg, len_msg)`**

   * RAX = 1
   * RDI = 1 (stdout)
   * RSI = address of your string
   * RDX = its length
     → `syscall` prints “Hello World…”

2. **`exit(status)`**

   * RAX = 60
   * RDI = the byte-count you just printed
     → `syscall` terminates your process, returning that count as the exit code.

---

**Bottom line:** a system call is simply the kernel’s front door—an architected, safe way for programs to request privileged operations without breaking isolation or security.
