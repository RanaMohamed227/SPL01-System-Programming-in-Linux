Architecture:

Note: shell is not only around the kernel but the applications and utilities can also interact with it.


- Hardware: processor - Ram - Peripherals, etc.
- kernel : software - c code - the first layer that deals with the hardware - manage the hardware system - interrupt, caches . Software mangament of the hardware processor ... assembly and c code. not only the processor but the whole hardware system peripherals.
- User space applications :
      - shell: command line calls the kernel to do the instructions - devices driver instruction and user managment and network managment .
      - we can not let all applications call the hardware but the kernel is the only place you can access the hardware.

kernel space: the modes that run in kernel mode --> privileged mode.
    Hardware architecture is dependent on kernel mode: assembly code that only uses the current hardware features.
        device drivers : such as network card -->software driving the device drivers platform dependant kernel -->configure registars
    non hardware architecture: organization of files or process management or scheduling -->platform independant code

 to handle all of this we use system call interface :
     this is what the developer sees to talk with the kernel.
 
    
user space: non-privileged -- user bugs -- applications 
   - can directly talk with the kernel
   - can talk with the library gilbc that handles the talking
   - gilbc -- specification or most used instructions -- such as print , string.
   - some operations are handled by gilbc only no need to use kernel with gilbc .


**How to run a user space applications**:
 1- the processor runs first with bootloader running the kernel . 
 2- kernel first runs in priviliged mode intailize everything and configure the system.
 3- switch to user space so the user can start running his applications.
 4- switch to kernel if the user needs somethins from the kernel





Kernel Low-level classification :
 Divided into sub systems :

mono lithec kernel : Huge kernel with all functionalities -- centtral point of control -- manage the system effecintly -- but this is a huge kernel with large files and code.

micro kernel : like mac os -- small kernels divides into sub systems no vision on the whole system . easier to design


 Linux OS : GNU : user space /  Linux  : kernel 


 Linux distributions : 
   kernel + application + libraries 

   custom distributions:
   such as ubuntu 


 Yocto : make the Linux distribution -- customized 


Kernel module : small module if needed for some hardware devices
