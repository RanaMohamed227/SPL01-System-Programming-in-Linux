# What is virtualization :

share resources between multiple users implemented in hardware 

## Hypervisor : 
the hardware can not start virtualization directily so we use hypervisor  
The hypervisor is a software running on the pc --virtual -- its a program that helps me build a os on my computer

## Full virtualization
**The Guest OS does not know its running in virtual environment*
OS -->
Host OS 
Hypervisor 
Guest OS 
User software 

## Para virtualization
No Host OS 
the hypervisor is bare metal 
**The Guest know its running in virtual environment* compiled differentily 


Virtualization vs emulation:

Virtualization : divide resources same core 
Emulation : emulate new hardware on onther hardware like i am working on 8086 and emulate on it an Arm processor 
-- emulator is more like a translator that translates between this type of hardware an another.
