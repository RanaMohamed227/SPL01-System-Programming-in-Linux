**When many were staring at this time to use the OS and create many closed source software tools someone did not like how the software mindset was shifting**.

This man is Richard Stallman , he beilved in four software freedoms 

1- Freedom to RUN the software

2- Study the software 

3- Share it 

4- Modify it 

So, he created the GNU project 
**GNU is not Unix*
Free as in freedom*

**Unix like OS but without any code from AT&T OR any commercial company*.

The GNU General Publec licence (GPL): a series of widely free software licenses that guarantee end users the four freedom.
they created systems from scratch such as
1- Shell 
2- GCC -->  GNU C Compiler


To prevent many from taking this system and developing it and selling it they released it as GPL to guarantee these freedoms without anyone benefiting from it.
and if anyone used GNU they must release it to the community.

**GNU created the utilites but they did not create the Unix Kernel**

The creation of Linux: surrounding conditions
1- Hardware evolved 
2- Internet evolved 
3- MINIx , Unix system --> Andrew created Unix like OS for academical use. very hardware independant--> for portabality and educational purposes 

## Linus torvalds (one of Andrew students) wrote the first kernel version in 1991 runa on 8086 and very hardware effecient(not portable). 
The kernel released With GPL -- He created a huge room for development and new releases 


The email sent from MINIx mailing lists : one of the famous linux mails.

*The linux became the tool base for many companies this helped in developing the kernel*.

Developers are hired for the purpose of developing into the kerenl and contribute it.
