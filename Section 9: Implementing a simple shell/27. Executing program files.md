âœ… Explanation of the Program Execution Slide:
Program 1 Executable:

- Contains text (instructions) and data sections.

- Runs in the user space.

- Accesses resources such as open files in the kernel space.

-- exec() System Call:

- Replaces the current process image with a new program image.

- Keeps the same process ID (PID) but loads a new executable.

>> Program 2 Executable:

- The original program (Program 1) is completely replaced by the new program (Program 2).

- The new program has its own text (instructions) and data sections.

- Open resources (e.g., file descriptors) are generally retained across the exec() call.

>> User Space and Kernel Space:

- Both programs run in the user space but can access shared resources in the kernel space.

*** Summary *** :

exec() does not create a new process but replaces the current process with a new program, reusing the existing PID. âœ…âœ…âœ…ðŸ™‚

âœ… How execve() Works:
Locate Executable:

The kernel locates the executable file specified by pathname.

Check File Type:

If it is a binary executable, it directly executes.

If it is a script (starting with #!), it invokes the interpreter specified.

Load the Program:

The existing program is terminated.

The new program is loaded into the process's memory space.

The text (code), data, and stack segments are re-initialized.

Set Up Stack:

The arguments (argv) and environment variables (envp) are pushed onto the stack.

Start Execution:

The process begins execution from the program's entry point (main() function).





âœ… Return Values of execve()
The return value behavior of execve() is unique and essential to understand. Here is the detailed explanation:

1. Successful Execution:
If execve() is successful, it never returns to the calling process.

The current process image is completely replaced by the new executable, and the new program starts execution from its main() function.
