**They wanted to creat os between computers thatis affordable and time sharing so the project Multics was born**


## Multics :
  Multi information and computing service -- the project was developed MIT(Design) and General electric (machine) an Bell labs (developers).

  The project was not completed because bell labs relieased that this not a fast revenue and general electric withdrawed a year after. So, Multics has failed.
  BUT the novel ideas from this project still found in our OS such as the file system nowadays in our computers.

## Bell labs 

founded by Graham bell 1880 now its part of AT&T 
- Innovationa at bell labs transistores , laser ,etc 
**Developers worked on Multics**:
- Dennis Richie
- Ken Thompson -- DEC PDP series --> mini computer

- The Unix OS was created on this mini computer
    the OS design was very advanced for the computers at these days , the ideas was very advanced so Unix came at it means Uni or simplified.

  In three weeks:
  he wrote
  1- Editor
  2- Assembeler
  3- Kernel
  The c language was not even created they used the op code and very low level methods so the assembler was built to compile this code instead of writing a machine code.

The OS then implemnted on a better machine called PDP-11 
but there was a problem the machine code on this computer was different from the one Ken used to work on hence the assembly is different from it , too.
so, they rewrote it again on PDP-11. 
## Thats not portable 

**So, The C language was created by Dennis --> it was inspired by the B language Ken Thompson invented**.
The compiler will generate the machine code from the c code --> portable.
The C language was invented because of the need to be able to install this OS on every computer.

  The always marketed or distribuited their work as a source code --> open source project so everyone had the access to read and see how the system was implemnted , 
  on the other hand at the same time some companies were creating their operating system as a closed systems and downloaded on the computers no one was able to see inside it.


Some startups were founded that developed this OS and gained money so, there were problems!!
-- USL (Unix system laboratory) --> responsible for Unix development

**UC berkeley additions* :
- founded TCPIP stack

The problems ended by removing the core of Unix additions 

Some are open source now and some are not.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unix is now implemnted differently between many users so, a standarlization was created.
 AT&T --> published specifications for Unix system not the internal implemnation more like a manual guide for Unix.
to demonstrate how this OS works and portable --> the portability was the main goal here to help many use it on different machines.

Now many can take the specifications and implemnetd Unix system and reseve the trade mark (it was famous but now its not that important)

The Unix evolution :- A MASSIVE tree shaped history....
