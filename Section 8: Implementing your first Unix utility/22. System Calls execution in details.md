## What is wrapper function 

-- function that does some things then calls another function

- system call in the kernel are numbered --> we can find it in file asm

calling execve --> c function 


steps to make a system call 
1- software intrreupt triggered by assembly instruction --> we find the assembly instruction in mn asses 
2- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473504af-a66e-48bf-9bcb-dbf98f79baec)

3-  system calls invoke the c library that calls a wrapper to do some machine code to call the system call in the kernel
so the c library abstracts us from the processes by calling a wrapper 
ring 0--> kerel 
ring 3 --> user
trap handler --> system call
system call table --> function pointer table and does the function corresponding to the function in the table 

sytem calll has arguments and numbers and return value 
arguments --> user mode to kerenl mode
return value --> kerel to user 
both have two different stacks 
cpu registers are the common registers that we can use to store the paramters and communicate between the kernel and the user 
before we do the command or the system call we call the number then we put the place to store the return value

libc --> wrappers that does all the above machine code
